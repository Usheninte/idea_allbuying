My first ever, began on &lt;em&gt;May 1st 2018&lt;/em&gt; and lasted till &lt;em&gt;August 8th&lt;/em&gt;. Coding is fun and exciting, and I am eager to teach a whole new community at my university Lead City, to code and become world-class developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What will I be focusing on in this round? Well, here is a list of just a few technologies, I will be working with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;MongoDB&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;React&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Redux&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Python&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Flask&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;MongooseJS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Join me as I work to become a world-class developer. It is not going to be easy, but I am willing to put in all the effort needed. I look forward to changing the way Africans interact with the internet, for the better.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Today is Day 3 of my second #100DaysOfCode challenge this year.
