Today is Day 3 of my second #100DaysOfCode challenge this year. My first ever, began on _May 1st 2018_ and lasted till _August 8th_. Coding is fun and exciting, and I am eager to teach a whole new community at my university Lead City, to code and become world-class developers.

What will I be focusing on in this round? Well, here is a list of just a few technologies, I will be working with:
* MongoDB
* React
* Redux
* Python
* Flask
* MongooseJS

Join me as I work to become a world-class developer. It is not going to be easy, but I am willing to put in all the effort needed. I look forward to changing the way Africans interact with the internet, for the better.
