The journey began on Friday **September 7th 2018**. I will not say the project is finished, even though there is a completely functional version up for installation as a [package on the NPM registry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-fcctest). This is a milestone for me, as the project is my first Open Source contribution.

I used certain key technologies to make the project a reality:
* Webpack
* React 
* NPM
* Node.js

I will try to make this as brief as possible. I tried several times (for a whole day actually), before I could even succeed in make the plugin functional. Upon making it functional, implementation in a React app became a hassle. Time and time again, I was faced with technical difficulties, yet still I overcame. I cannot say how much **_Google Search_** aided me, in solving my problems on my own.

In the end, I figured out how to implement the plugin (and make it actually function as a plugin - with minimal setup and installation), and thus my job was largely done. I tested it out in a real-world freeCodeCamp project and it functioned perfectly. Webpack truly helped to glue everything together perfectly.

That is all there is to it!

My 2018 so far, has been amazing. I got accepted as the first **_Developer Student Club Lead_** for my university, in a program powered by **Google Developers**. I earned _12+ coding-related certificates_ during the Summer vacation; and much more is coming. I am aiming for greatness, in outer space - perhaps I might just land on a moon. More tech stories are coming soon.
