Hi there, I am Usheninte, a software developer interested in **Innovation**, the **Arts** and **Entrepreneurship**. I believe big dreams, are pushed by and executed with big ideas. Everyone has a dream - you do too. Tell me your dream, and leave the heavy tech lifting to me. All we need, to make the world a more beautiful place, is an idea!

#### >> [RoyalsCollectives](https://royalscollectives.com/)
I had a lot of fun building this project. This was completed during Round 2 of my #100DaysOfCode Challenge.

RoyalsCollectives, is an art and illustration brand. The concepts tackled and portrayed by the brand, are typically urban and entertainment centred. What I simply did, was bring to life their best pieces as at when I built the web app.
