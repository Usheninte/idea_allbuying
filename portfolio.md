Hi there, I am Usheninte, a software developer interested in **Innovation**, the **Arts** and **Entrepreneurship**. I believe big dreams, are pushed by and executed with big ideas. Everyone has a dream - you do too. Tell me your dream, and leave the heavy tech lifting to me. All we need, to make the world a more beautiful place, is an idea!
